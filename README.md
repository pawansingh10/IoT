   - The designing, developing and maintaining and enabling the large technology to IoT is quite complicated


### **Embedded Devices in IoT**
***
- The term Embedded System is important in IoT
- The embedded devices are the objects that build unique computing system.
- The embedded sysyem may orn may not be connected to interet

- An Embedded device system generally runs as a single application. However these devices can connect through internet and able to communicate through other network devices

* **Embedded System Hardware**
- The embedded system can be of type **MicroController** and **MicroProcessor**

> ***Micro-Controller : A microcontroller is a chip optimized to control electronic devices.\
 It is stored in a single integrated circuit which is dedicated to performing a particular task and execute one specific application***

> ***Micro-Processor : A microprocessor is a controlling unit of a micro-computer wrapped inside a small chip.\It performs Arithmetic Logical Unit (ALU) operations and communicates with the other devices connected with it.\ It is a single Integrated Circuit in which several functions are combined.***

* **Micro-Controller vs Micro-Processor**
  | **Micro-Processor**        | **Micro-Controller**| 
  |------------------------|-------------------|
  |Microprocessor consists of only a Central Processing Unit|whereas Micro Controller contains a CPU, Memory, I/O all integrated into one chip.|
  |Microprocessor is used in Personal Computers |Micro Controller is used in an embedded system.|
  |Microprocessor uses an external bus to interface to RAM, ROM, and other peripherals|on the other hand, Microcontroller uses an internal controlling bus.|
  |Microprocessors are based on Von Neumann model|Micro controllers are based on Harvard architecture|
  |Microprocessor is complicated and expensive, with a large number of instructions to process|Microcontroller is inexpensive and straightforward with fewer instructions to process.|
